This is my first git repository while learning this platform 
Cmd 1 : git checkout filename ( files changes revert to last commit )
For all files : git checkout -f

Cmd 2: git log (what commits you have written)
For seeing specific no. of commit info : git log -p -no.ofcommits

Cmd 3: git diff (compares working tree with staging area)

Cmd 4: git diff --staged   (compares staging area with last commit)
Cmd 5: git commit -a -m “msg” (skip staging area and direct commit the changes)

Cmd 6: git rm –cached filename ( remove file  from git tracking tree)
Cmd 7: git rm filename (remove file from hard disk)
Cmd 8: git status -s (tells small status for working tree)
Cmd 9 : git branch branchName ( create branch)
Cmd 10: git branch (shows total branches and currently we are where)
Cmd 11: git checkout branchName ( switched to this branch)
Cmd 12: git checkout master (switched to master branch)
Cmd 13: git merge branchName ( when you are in master branch then you can use it to merge your branch with master)
Cmd 14: git checkout -b branchName ( branch is created and switched to this branch)
